# ViCiDial Keep Alive
Welcome to my page regarding the ViCiDial Keep Alive Extension! It's a Chrome Extension that will maintain the keep alive heartbeat from ViCiDial's frontend to the backend. I hope you find it useful!

# Why?
Google and Chrome developers are constantly trying to make the user experience on Chrome as awesome as they possibly can with every release. One of the ways they are trying to achieve this is by throttling JavaScript execution on non-active pages to save precious resources. This is great for most users who don't want their battery being drained by a website they're not even looking at but it's bad for ViCiDial which is designed to be running JavaScript constantly on a desktop machine. Matt Florell (creator and principle maintainer of ViCiDial) has written about this problem and provided some solutions to overcome the throttling -> http://vicidial.org/docs/WEB_BROWSER_JAVASCRIPT_THROTTLING.txt this Extension is aimed at people who are not yet ready to upgrade to the latest ViCiDial code for a variety of reasons.

# How to Use This
1) Download the Extension as a zip file (or clone the repo).

2) Extract contents to a folder.

3) Go to URL chrome://extensions in Chrome or navigate to the Extensions menu through the interface.

4) Enable "Developer Mode".

5) Click "Load Unpacked".

6) Select the ViCiDial Keep Alive Chrome Extension folder (ViCiDial-Keep-Alive-main\ViCiDial_Keep_Alive).
